# Sorting Comparison Test

---

A comparison of multiple common sorting algorithms that I coded in Java.
The comparison is multithreaded, so they should be performed at the same time to save on time by the user.

To run the program, execute the main method in [src/SortingComparisonTest.java](src/SortingComparisonTest.java).
